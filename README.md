## Project Overview

This project analyzes U.S. honey production data from 1998-2012, focusing on trends before and after the Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) crisis of 2006. The data comes from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

## Key Questions Explored

1. How has honey production yield changed from 1998 to 2012?
2. Which states produce the most/least honey and how has this changed?
3. Are there visible trends in colonies/yield before and after 2006?
4. What patterns exist between production and value over time?

## Data Wrangling Highlights

- Cleaned inconsistent state names and missing values
- Validated production calculations (numcol Ã— yieldpercol = totalprod)
- Created time-series features for year-over-year analysis
- Added regional aggregations for broader analysis
- Flagged data quality issues for transparency
